iRuler -- Remote editing of F5 BigIP iRules with vim

Getting Started
---------------
Use Vundle or Pathogen to load http://github.com/wfaulk/iRuler.vim

Inside vim, run ":F5Connect" to connect to your BigIP, then run
":F5GetRules" to get a list of rules.  (They will be folded; use "zo"
to open folds.)  Move your cursor to the iRule you want to edit and
run ":F5OpenRule".  Edit the rule as desired, then run ":F5PubRule" to
upload your changes.

Notes
-----
iRuler requires a python-enabled vim.

iRuler currently includes the python modules pycontrol and suds.  This
may change to a prerequisite, but I personally had trouble with keeping
them elsewhere non-global and having MacVim find them.

Credits
-------
The majority of the functional code is taken directly from vim-iruler
<https://devcentral.f5.com/d/vim-based-irule-editor> but updated to
work better as a Pathogen/Vundle plugin.
